# Crime_prediction
Many important questions in public safety and protection relate to crime, and a better understanding of crime is beneficial in multiple ways: it can lead to targeted and sensitive practices by law enforcement authorities to mitigate crime, and more concerted efforts by citizens and authorities to create healthy neighborhood environments.
With the advent of the Big Data era and the availability of fast, efficient algorithms for data analysis, understanding patterns in crime from data is an active and growing field of research.
The inputs to our algorithms are time (hour, day, month, and year), place (latitude and longitude), and a class of crime:
• Act 379 - Robbery
• Act 13 - Gambling
• Act 279 - Accident
• Act 323 - Violence
• Act 302 - Murder
• Act 363 - Kidnapping
The output is the class of crime that is likely to have occurred. We try out multiple classification algorithms, such as KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Trees...
We also perform multiple classification tasks – we first try to predict which of 6 classes of crimes are likely to have occurred, and later try to differentiate between violent and non-violent crimes.
