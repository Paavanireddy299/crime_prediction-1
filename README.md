# Crime_prediction

The inputs to our algorithms are time (hour, day, month, and year), place (latitude and longitude), and a class of crime:

  • Act 379 - Robbery
  
  • Act 13 - Gambling
  
  • Act 279 - Accident
  
  • Act 323 - Violence
  
  • Act 302 - Murder
  
  • Act 363 - Kidnapping
  
The output is the class of crime that is likely to have occurred. We try out multiple classification algorithms, such as KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Decision Trees...
We also perform multiple classification tasks – we first try to predict which of 6 classes of crimes are likely to have occurred, and later try to differentiate between violent and non-violent crimes.
